# `rmw_fastrtps_cpp` Quality Declaration

The package `rmw_fastrtps_cpp` claims to be in the **Quality Level 2** category.

Below are the rationales, notes, and caveats for this claim, organized by each requirement listed in the [Package Requirements for Quality Level 2 in REP-2004](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2004.html).

## Version Policy [1]

### Version Scheme [1.i]

`rmw_fastrtps_cpp` uses `semver` according to the recommendation for ROS Core packages in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#versioning).

The license for `rmw_fastrtps_cpp` is Apache 2.0, and a summary is in each source file, the type is declared in the [package.xml](package.xml) manifest file, and a full copy of the license is in the [LICENSE](../LICENSE) file.

There is an automated test which runs a linter that ensures each file has a license statement.

Most recent test results can be found [here](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/rmw_fastrtps_cpp/copyright/)

### Copyright Statements [3.iv]

The copyright holders each provide a statement of copyright in each source code file in `rmw_fastrtps_cpp`.

There is an automated test which runs a linter that ensures each file has at least one copyright statement.

The results of the test can be found [here](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/rmw_fastrtps_cpp/copyright/).

## Testing [4]

### Feature Testing [4.i]

All `rmw_fastrtps_cpp` public features are ROS middleware features.

Unit, integration, and system tests higher up in the stack, such as those found in [`test_rmw_implementation`](https://github.com/ros2/rmw_implementation/tree/master/test_rmw_implementation), [`test_rclcpp`](https://github.com/ros2/system_tests/tree/master/test_rclcpp), and [`test_communication`](https://github.com/ros2/system_tests/tree/master/test_communication) packages, provide feature coverage. Nightly CI jobs in [`ci.ros2.org`](https://ci.ros2.org/) and [`build.ros2.org`](https://build.ros2.org/), where `rmw_fastrtps_cpp` is the default `rmw` implementation, thoroughly exercise this middleware.

### Public API Testing [4.ii]

`rmw_fastrtps_cpp` implements the ROS middleware public API, but also provides public API of its own.

Unit tests located in the [`test`](https://github.com/ros2/rmw_fastrtps/tree/master/rmw_fastrtps_cpp/test) directory provide coverage for public but `rmw_fastrtps_cpp` specific API.
New additions or changes to this API require tests before being added.

Unit, integration, and system tests higher up in the stack, such as those found in [`test_rmw_implementation`](https://github.com/ros2/rmw_implementation/tree/master/test_rmw_implementation), [`test_rclcpp`](https://github.com/ros2/system_tests/tree/master/test_rclcpp), and [`test_communication`](https://github.com/ros2/system_tests/tree/master/test_communication) packages, ensure compliance with the ROS middleware API specification (see [`rmw`](https://github.com/ros2/rmw) package) and further extend coverage.

### Coverage [4.iii]

`rmw_fastrtps_cpp` follows the recommendations for ROS Core packages in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#code-coverage), and opts to use branch coverage instead of line coverage.

This includes:

- tracking and reporting line coverage statistics
- achieving and maintaining a reasonable branch line coverage (90-100%)
- no lines are manually skipped in coverage calculations

Changes are required to make a best effort to keep or increase coverage before being accepted, but decreases are allowed if properly justified and accepted by reviewers.

Current coverage statistics can be viewed [here](https://ci.ros2.org/job/ci_linux_coverage/lastSuccessfulBuild/cobertura/src_ros2_rmw_fastrtps_rmw_fastrtps_cpp_src/).

This package claims to meet the coverage requirements for the current quality level, even though it doesn't have 95% line coverage.
The justification is that the only uncovered lines have to do with system resource exhaustion and Fast DDS internal failure.

A summary of how these statistics are calculated can be found in the [ROS 2 On-boarding guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#note-on-coverage-runs).

### Performance [4.iv]

`rmw_fastrtps_cpp` does not currently have performance tests.

### Linters and Static Analysis [4.v]

`rmw_fastrtps_cpp` uses and passes all the standard linters and static analysis tools for a C++ package as described in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#linters-and-static-analysis).

Results of the nightly linter tests can be found [here](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/rmw_fastrtps_cpp).

It has several "buildtool" dependencies, which do not affect the resulting quality of the package, because they do not contribute to the public library API.
It also has several test dependencies, which do not affect the resulting quality of the package, because they are only used to build and run the test code.

### Direct Runtime Non-ROS Dependencies [5.iii]

`rmw_fastrtps_cpp` has the following runtime non-ROS dependencies.
* `fastcdr`: *eProsima Fast CDR* claims to be Quality Level 2. For more information, please refer to its [QUALITY DECLARATION](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-CDR/blob/master/QUALITY.md)
